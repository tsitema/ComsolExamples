# ComsolExamples
Some examples of laser and photonic lattice simulations.

* **ClassB_laser_model_wahw.mph** 

1D Class-B semiconductor laser model using Wave Form PDE module
* **Lieb_lattice_perforated.mph** 

Band structure calculations of a Lieb lattice on Si with perforated holes.
* **QCL_Polarization_Rotator.mph** 

Mode calculations of a quantum cascade laser waveguide with asymmetric metal strip to rotate polarization.
* **QCL_thermal.mph** 

Calculates the time dependent cavity temperatures of a quantum cascade laser operating in pulsed mode.
* **Si_nanopillar_Lieb_lattice.mph** 

Band structure calculations of a Lieb lattice realized by silicon nanopillars with 3 different radii.
* **Si_nanopillar_square_lattice.mph** 

Band structure calculations of a square lattice of silicon nanopillars.
* **Square_lattice_perforated.mph** 

Band structure calculations of a square lattice on Si with perforated holes.

* **Topological_Maxwell_Waves_Slab_Corner.mph**

A slab waveguide to demonstrate topological surface Maxwell waves. It consists of two adjacent slab waveguides with different permittivity and permeability. Surface waves are excited by a dipole at the interface.

* **LaserAnnealing.mph**

Annealing of a material with a moving Gaussian beam. Annealing increases the material's absorbtion coefficient according to Arrhenius equation.
